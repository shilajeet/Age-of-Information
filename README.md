## Age-of-Information

In this repo I have implemented the following algorithms:

* Threshold based Status Update Policy
* Best Effort uniform Update Policy 

# Problem Setup
An energy harvesting sensor powers a source of information generating a periodic status update to a receiver through a non-stationary wireless channel. The sensor harvests energy from the nature and stores it in a battery to power current and future update operations. For this problem setup we assume channel state to be Good all the time.  Objective is to design an optimal status update algorithm that will minimize the long-term average AoI at the receiver subject to energy constraint.
